          Its impacts on the poorest people in our society and our planetâ€™s
          biodiversity are cause for particular concern. Looking at the worst
          possible scenarios, it could be an important factor that increases
          existential threats from other sources, like great power conflicts,
          nuclear war, or pandemics.

          But because the worst potential consequences seem to run through those
          other sources, and these other risks seem larger and more neglected,
          we think most readers can have a greater impact in expectation working
          directly on one of these other risks.

          We think your personal carbon footprint is much less important than
          what you do for work, and that some ways of making a difference on
          climate change are likely to be much more effective than others. In
          particular, you could use your career to help develop technology or
          advocate for policy that would reduce our current emissions, or
          research technology that could remove carbon from the atmosphere in
          the future.

      "Current policies and action, leading to 340-357 MtCO2e in 2030, fall far short of meeting its conditional NDC target (96 MtCO2e). The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the Philippines’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. A further reduction of 24-27% is required to meet fair share obligations, and 64-66% reduction to be in line with a 1.5°C domestic pathway. If all countries were to follow the Philippines’ current policies and action approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.",
      "The Philippines’ Energy Plan (PEP 2020-2040) is carbon-intensive and relies on high levels of fossil gas imports and generation for the future energy mix. The coal moratorium is a positive step, but there is already a high level of coal in the current energy mix (57%, 14 GW) with a further 2.6 GW addition capacity exempt from the moratorium under the PEP.",
      "The National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) 2020-2040 sets an aspirational target for a 35% renewable energy share in power generation by 2030, and 50% by 2040. The PEP 2020-2040 forecasts an up to 2240% increase in solar power generation from 2020 to 2030, a large increase due to the low current levels of generation (just 1 TWh in 2020).",
      "Recent plans to expand the role of fossil gas in the system by building terminals to import LNG by early 2023 do not contribute to the country’s energy independence and would lock in large-scale fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a barrier to moving to zero emissions power generation.",

In order to achieve its fair share contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C, the Philippines would need to reach absolute emissions of at or below 260 MtCO2e in 2030. Its unconditional target would therefore need to be at least 124 MtCO2e lower than it currently is.",

The Philippines’ target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort.

Recent government data shows a shrinking net sink, with estimates of -21.6 MtCO2/yr in the LULUCF sector for 2021.
